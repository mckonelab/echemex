Scripts for processing experimental electrochemistry data

## Overview
This repository contains scripts that convert raw .DTA files from the experimental electrochemistry Gamry Framework software into numpy arrays for manipulation in python. Currently, only cyclic voltammetry experiments can be converted, but chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, and other experimental techniques will shortly be included. Recommendations and requests for additional functionality are welcome and appreciated.
